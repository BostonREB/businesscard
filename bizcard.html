	<div>
		<p>I've been an attorney for the past 14 years with a practice focused primarily on business and employment litigation.  I have, however left the legal profession to pursue a career in development.  I've simply had enough of being a practicing attorney day in and day out.</p>
		<p>I currently live in Allston, MA.  I grew up in Atlantic City, NJ also spent about a dozen years living in Philadephia, PA.</p>
